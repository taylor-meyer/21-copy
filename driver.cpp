I was playing the 21 dlc for Resident Evil 7
and thought, "I can probably re-create this!"

I'll start with text base, and then I can use this
as a way to learn unity and get some 2D graphics going!

		"Resident Evil 7 DLC.\nEverything is bare bones for now, "
		"but I will do my best to implement the rest of the features!\n";

	std::cout << intro << std::endl;


	// sys(pause) is bad practice but we are just playing for now.
	system("PAUSE");
